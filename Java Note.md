### Java

#### Object-Oriented Programming Concepts 超級大重點!!!


##### Object
- Having two characteristics : States | Behavior
- Instance of a class


##### Class
- **Data type of Object**


##### Inheritance
- Renew **functions of old class** in new class
- If child class is inheritance from parent class, **child class** will obtain all properties and behaviors of parent class


##### Polymorphism
- Like Union in C# etc (having one variable name but several datatype)
- [Extention] Able to use same variable name in both parent and child class


##### Abstraction (抽象化)
- Hide certain information of function and showing only necessary datail for input/output

##### Encapsulation
-

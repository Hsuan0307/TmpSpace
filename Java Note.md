### Java

#### Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

##### Object
- Having two characteristics : States | Behavior
- Instance of a class


##### Class
- **Data type of Object**


##### Inheritance
- Renew **functions of old class** in new class
- If child class is inheritance from parent class, **child class** will obtain all properties and behaviors of parent class


##### Polymorphism
- Like Union in C# etc (having one variable name but several datatype)
